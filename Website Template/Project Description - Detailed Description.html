							<h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
							<h3>Initial Concept</h3>
							<p> placeholder </p>
							<h3>Development</h3>
							<p> placeholder </p>
							<h3>Coding the game</h3>
							<p>The idea for creating the game was to design a functioning battle scenario using Unity, the group had no experience using Unity, so group member Oscar volunteered to try and learn how to develop this game using unity. Firstly, the HUD For the battle scenario was created depicting a statement like “You have encountered an Enemy'' and to the right of that were options ‘Fight’ and ‘Flee’, a Pokémon text box was used as a placeholder before the art team developed an original HUD.(see Figure 1) This was just a visual aid, the plan was to make the ‘Fight’ and ‘Flee’ option selectable and they would open new selectable options. Before this process was worked on, a background, character and health bar were added. The background used was a placeholder from Final Fantasy, that was going to be replaced by a background created by the art team, the character health bars were just coloured boxes and text, this was also a place holder (See Figure 2). From here the scripts must be added to the text to allow them to be selectable. This is were a major obstacle was placed in front of us, being unfamiliar with unity, Oscar did not know that the coding was done using C#, a language that he and the rest of the group was unfamiliar with. To try and grasp as much information as possible in the short time we had, he tried researching the similar games done in unity, he stumbled across a person remaking a Pokemon game in unity, which contains a similar fight scenario to our game. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pm16a18zy8&t=3s) . After watching many of these videos, created by Game Dev Experiments, and trying to implement the code shown in the videos to our battle scenario, it was made very clear that without a prior understanding of C# that it would be unfeasible to create a functioning and good battle scenario that our game depicts. Furthermore, we did not want to be plagiaristic and just completely copy Game Dev Experiments code and just change the images and animation to fit our game, as that is unethical and there is no learning that comes from that. </p>
							<p>Ultimately, the idea of creating a battle scenario in unity was scrapped, but the group still wanted some sort of interactable prototype that a user could play with to understand how the battle scenario would work in this type of game. So again, Oscar would work on creating this, instead of unity, a text based version was going to be created using Python, a language our whole group was familiar with. The battle scenario for this game was condensed into one ‘While loop’ that would always run so long as the player’s or enemy's health was above 0 (See figure 3). Within this loop there were multiple if and elif statements that gave the user various options when fighting an enemy. The first set of options to pick from were attack, inventory, recharge mana and flee, from which more options were available, except for flee as it ends the battle. Attack gives the player a list of 4 attacks to choose, each attack requires a specific amount of mana based on the amount of damage. This is where an obstacle arises, as doing damage to the enemy and the enemy  damaging the player were in the same ‘if’ statement, meaning that both the enemy and player attack at the same time, potentially leaving both of them to be defeated. In order to remedy this, an new ‘if’ statement was created allowing the enemy to attack only if its hp was above 0, which created a turn based system rather them both attacking at the same time . Another problem that arouse was that when a player used a health potion in the inventory it allowed their HP do go above 100, after consulting the group, Mark gave the simple answer of inserting a line of code into the ‘if’ statement stating when the players hp is above 100, always set the value to 100.</p>
							<p>After the main crux of the battle scenario was completed, such as the move list, enemy doing damage, inventory created and mana recharge option complete. There was just some minor quality of life improvements to add, such as if the user does not enter the correct option it gives them the message “Enter the corresponding number” and also adding little features such as the amount of mana each attack requires. Overall, the battle scenario was clearly portrayed in a text format using python, after many hurdles and obstacles, the playable prototype was completed.</p>

							<h4>Random Encounters</h4>
							<p> Here is a design for an enemy: a Scarf Dragon! (Also goes by MrStealYoScarf) </p>
							<p> Below is the what the player sees when first encountering the dragon, with the second image being the final pose the dragon takes once it goes through its encounter animation. </p>
							<img src='images/Mrstealyoscarf Still.png' style='width:50%'>
							<img src='images/Mrstealyoscarf FP Still.png' style='width:50%'>
							<br>
							<p> The encounter animation shown below plays when the dragon appears on the UI, much like the Pokemon games(reference here). It remains unfinished. The tool used here, Piskel, removed the transparent background as there were too many hues and shades combined with too many frames. </p>
							<img src='images/gifs/Mrstealyoscarf 1fps.gif'>
							<img src='images/gifs/Mrstealyoscarf Fast.gif'>
							<img src='images/gifs/Mrstealyoscarf Final Pos.gif'>
							<p> What would need to be finished was the transition from the first/second gif to the third gif (the first and second gifs are the same, though the former is played at 1 frame per second while the latter at 11). The first/second gif will be henceforth named V1 and the third V2. V1 finishes as the dragon is turning to our right. What needed to be finished was animating its tail whipping back to look like that of V2 (think cat tail whips). The dragon's head turns to our left such that we see its side view, then opens its mouth to breath fire. In V2, the fire illuminates its face, tinting the planes that are facing the flame. Once the flame starts dying out, said planes are shaded darker until the hues look like V1. </p>

							<h4>Side Story 1</h4>
							<p>In the real world, the player walks for 500 metres and they meet a fictional character named Jenna. In the game, the player walks past a dungeon and outside the dungeon, *the character* encounter a wanderer named Jenna</p>
							<p>Jenna: Hello, *The character* My name is Jenna and I was given a task by my king to investigate these areas. When I was wandering around these areas, I found something unusual here. I think you can check it out, though I would suggest bringing more friends, but I think you can handle it yourself. Good luck.</p>
							<p>*The character*: Why should I head in there?</p>
							<p>Jenna: I heard the enemies in the dungeon are keeping a lot of valuable loot inside, so I think it is something that you would like.</p>
							<p>*The character*: Alright, I’ll see what I can do.</p>
							<p>Jenna: Good luck, *the character*</p>
							<p>In the real world, the player can choose to wait for a few people to join him, once they too have already walked 500 metres or they can choose to do it alone. Once the player has already chosen their option, they can head inside the dungeon. In the game, *The character* heads inside the dungeon to find 3 enemies standing in the gate. *The character* then fights them off and heads inside the dungeon. Once the player heads inside the dungeon, they suddenly find a mini boss on the way surrounded by 2 other enemies. *The character* then fights them both off and head inside where the enemies have been keeping the treasure room, but before they can grab any of the treasure, a big boss showed up and *the character* fights the big boss to claim their reward. They fought the boss and they claimed their treasure. *The character* then leaves the dungeon, where they met Jenna again.</p>
							<p>Jenna: Congratulations on slaying the beast. I think my kingdom might use someone like you to help us. Hopefully, we will be able to talk soon. Goodbye for now.</p>
							<p>In the real world, the player would need to walk in a real life shop in their respective country to be able to access the in-game shop. In the game’s shop, you find a man named Marcus.</p>
							<h4>Introduction to the shop</h4>
							<p>Marcus: Hello *The character*. Pleased to meet you. My name is Marcus and I am a blacksmith who will be supplying you with items and if you ever need to resupply your armor, you can also head over to me and I will get you sorted in a jiffy. See you around and good luck on your travels.</p>
							<h4>Side Story 2</h4>
							<p>In the real world, the player would walk around for around 100 metres and in game, *The character* would stumble upon a stranger named Lily.</p>
							<p>Lily: Hello *The character*I am looking for 3 mushrooms. Can you help me find them? My name is Lilly by the way</p>
							<p>*The character*: Sure thing, Lily.</p>
							<p>Lily:Thank you. I will keep looking around the area.</p>
							<p>In the real world, the player would walk for around 50 metres in any direction and they would find one mushroom on the ground. Once the player has found all three mushrooms, they return back to Lily. </p>
							<p>Lily: Have you found it yet?</p>
							<p>*The character*: Yes</p>
							<p>Lily:Thank you. Please take these as a thank you gift.</p>
							<h4>Side Story 4</h4>
							<p>In real life, the player would walk around 60 metres and in game, *the character* found a group of enemies surrounding a person. The enemies then found you and are rapidly approaching.</p>
							<P>*The character*. *The character* then fights them and rescues the stranger. It turns out the stranger is a ballad for a bar.</p>
							<p>Reckless Ballad: Thank you *The character*. I thought I was done there. Please take these for your troubles.</p>
							<p>*The character*: Please be careful next time</p>
							<p>Reckless Ballad: I will, but everytime I see an enemy, I just can't help myself and have to fight it. *Sigh*, I guess that is why I was called the “Reckless ballad” by my friends. Again, thank you for your help and I hope I can be able to solve my issue.</p>



							










								





							<h4>Inventory and Currency</h4>
							<p> placeholder </p>
							
							<h4> Weapons and Items </h4>
							<p> Other RPG games feature 'Equipment Sets', where each unique clothing item is designed with a theme. Wearing pieces of the set together grants bonuses that pertains to a unique playstyle that usually differs from the 'main' or intended playstyle of the character. </p>
							<p> This set is for the black mage, and its theme is duality with the stereotypical light vs. dark trope. What springboarded the design process was the design of Leucoryx and his items (reference here) from Realm of the Mad God, which inspired the theme. </p>
							<p> The set remains unfinished. The robe, which hasn't been finalised, is intended to be the crux of the set and would be designed to have a 50/50 left/right split between the light and dark elements. As it stands, the boots and hat resemble a 70/30 split between their respective light/dark representations.</p>

							<h2>Risks</h2>
							<p> When developing a game there are always major risks that must be taken, sometimes you reap the rewards from these risks other times you must reformulate your strategy. A major risk that was taken was to use the software Unity for our game development, none of the group members were previously familiar with this software. When development of the battle scenario began on unity, it became very clear that without prior knowledge of the coding language C# that I would be extremely hard and unfeasible to create a strong and compelling battle scenario. The group decided that a text version of the battle scenario will be created using Python as we were all familiar with that language of coding. </p>
							<p>Another risk was the choosing of the art design that would be the overall feel of the game, the design team decided that pixel art would be a great aesthetic for the game. Unlike the software chosen for the game, this one seemed to pay off, as it creates this nostalgic feel to other games such as Pokémon and Final Fantasy, especially with a similar combat style. It also allowed for a wide variety of members to work on the art as it is a bit simpler than creating hyper-realistic character, armour and weapons. But, it also created a sense of originality and uniqueness by pairing this art design with the concept of augmented reality, as it takes two complete opposites and merges them together.</p>
							<p>But the major risk was choosing an RPG for the genre of game, simply because this genre has an unlimited amount of content that can be added, the options are endless. With a massive amount of ideas floating around, this is where communication can easily break down and conflicts of interest can arise. Thankfully, the group understood that because we can only focus on a small part of the game for the prototype, that we have to narrow in on the features that will be discussed. The group was very understanding of features that could not be added and no one took offense if a particular feature was too large to be added currently.</p>
