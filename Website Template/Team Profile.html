							<h2>James Tohme</h2>
							<img src="images/james.JPG" width="350">
							<p>Hello! My name is James Mark Tohme, and my student number is s3897700. I come from Australia and was raised in the Melbourne suburb of Roxburgh Park. I enjoy playing classic video games, listening to pop songs, eating food, and speaking with my friends. My interest in IT swelled greatly as a result of me contributing to the tech-based subjects in Roxburgh College during 2020. I always knew I was going to pursue a career in IT, ever since I was young, learning how computers worked for the first time. What fascinated me the most about IT wasn't so much the exact operations or functions a computer could perform, it was more the paramount variability and options one had when exploring their path in the ever-growing industry. Thanks to my time in Roxburgh College, I was able to pick up essential skills, such as an intermediate knowledge of HTML coding, formatting websites, and a level of understanding on Python thanks to the crash courses I took.</p>
							<h2>Kenneth Pham</h2>
							<img src="images/Kenneth.jpeg" width="350">
							<p>Heya! I’m Kenneth Pham and my student number is s3895797. I am a first generation Vietnamese-Australian; English is my first language while Vietnamese is my second. I also graduated secondary school in 2020 and am undertaking my first year tertiary studies at RMIT, in a Bachelor of IT. While I am studying a STEM subject, I have a passion for the arts, including: drawing and painting, singing and dancing, though some I am more experienced at than others.</p>
							<p>My interest in IT stems from seeing programming being used for a game I played. It was not the programming of the game itself but rather individuals from the gaming community who programmed a simulator for the game that introduced me to the applications of IT, which thus sparked my interest in IT. My IT experience thus far is limited to what I have learnt at RMIT, which is to say that prior to my tertiary studies I had scarcely dabbled in IT at all.</p>
							<h2>Darren Lucky</h2>
							<img src="images/darren.jpg" width="350">
							<p>Greetings! my name is Darren Jonathan Lucky. My student number in RMIT is s3879744. I am Indonesian and I enjoy playing games, meeting new people, learning something new, exercising and learning about cars, whether it is their history or their performance. My main language is English, and I also can speak Indonesian and Chinese. Now, I am currently studying at RMIT University. I am studying for a Bachelor of IT and I am enjoying my experience at RMIT. My interest in IT started when I was still in primary school, and from there my interest grew. I began learning about databases, learning about the computer parts and when I attended foundation school, I learnt about programming, making a game using Scratch and various other topics that I am eager to learn. My IT experience began when I started primary school and I am continuing it until today. I don't really have a lot of IT experience, besides from school and that's about it. I hope I can expand my experience with RMIT.</p>
							<h2>Oscar Ascione</h2>
							<img src="images/Oscar.jpg" width="350">
							<p>My name is Oscar Ascione I was born and raised in Darwin, Northern Territory Australia. I am currently studying at RMIT, Bachelor of Information Technology, my student number s3888205. I did my schooling in Darwin and studied at the Essington School Darwin. Throughout high school, I did a lot of acting through the school system and attending acting classes out of school at a youth group called Corrugated Iron. I acted in an advertisement called ‘Speeding There’s No Future In it’. Currently, I am interested in the cyber security aspect of IT, delving into how companies protect their data and the creative ways cyber security attacks have been completed. My IT experience consists of doing work experience with a company called We Fix IT and another company called Power and water, learning about the mapping software they use for their powerlines</p>
							<h2>Joshua Renshaw</h2>
							<img src="images/Josh.jpg" width="350" height="500">
							<p>Hi, I am Joshua Renshaw, student number s3896215. I was born in London, England to an English father and a Finnish mother. As a result I am fluent in Finnish, however English is still my first language. I graduated secondary school in 2020 and am now taking a bachelors of IT course at RMIT. I enjoy video games, chess, soccer and cricket and almost anything to do with technology. My interest in IT sparked when I was given an old laptop when I was nine or ten because I wanted to play video games. I quickly determined that said laptop was not powerful enough to play the games I wanted to play, and I therefore decided to learn about computers in the hopes to someday have a more powerful one. Fast-forward to present day, and I have built two fairly powerful computers for myself in the past five years and have gained an interest in many other aspects of IT, including networking hardware and machine learning.</p>
							<h2>Mark Christopher</h2>
							<img src="images/Mark.png" width="350">
							<p>Heyyo! My name is Mark Tyrell Christopher, student number s3870180. I was born and raised in Indonesia. I've picked up digital art as a hobby and enjoy doing it on my leisure since I've learned the basics from school.I'm also slowly building my skills as a video editor. I graduated from highschool on 2020 and I’m furthering my education at RMIT where I'm studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology. My interest in IT began very early on when a relative of mine showed a game they made with their small team. I admired the game, as it was the first game I've ever experienced with a story, world, and fleshed out characters. As the technology of video games grew, my interest in video game making grew and I knew a job in the technology industry specifically in the video game industry was what I desired, as video games can build connections between people and give memorable experiences. The skills I have at the moment are those that I’m studying from my subjects at RMIT and hopefully I can learn more to reach my goals.</p>
